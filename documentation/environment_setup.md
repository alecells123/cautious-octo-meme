# Environment Setup

Development environments are referring to the different software that everyone on a development team is expected to use while developing for mutual projects. While working with these projects and assignments, it's easiest if everyone was using the same software. No software is perfect and they all have their pros and cons, but it's easiest to teach if everyone was experiencing the same pros and cons. All of the software we are using is actually top of the line, industry standard software that comes highly recommended by heaps of developers. They also work together very well. Let's get to it!

## Python

This is the programming language we will be using at first and for the majority of the projects. Sometimes there will be reasons to use others, but it will be rare and it is unlikely we will use them for a long time. Python is beautiful, easy to read and understand, and highly supported across devices and services. Learn to love it.
